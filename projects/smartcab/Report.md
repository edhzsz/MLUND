# Project Report 4: Reinforcement Learning
## Train a Smartcab How to Drive

### Implement a basic driving agent

_In your report, mention what you see in the agent’s behavior. Does it eventually make it to the target location?_

### Identify and update state

_Justify why you picked these set of states, and how they model the agent and its environment._

### Implement Q-Learning

_What changes do you notice in the agent’s behavior?_

### Enhance the driving agent

_Report what changes you made to your basic implementation of Q-Learning to achieve the final version of the agent. How well does it perform?_

_Does your agent get close to finding an optimal policy, i.e. reach the destination in the minimum possible time, and not incur any penalties?_
